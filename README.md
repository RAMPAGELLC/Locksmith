# Locksmith
Locksmith; Roblox virus threat removal & protection by Meta Games.

Locksmith is no longer being maintained as Roblox has taken down the plugin for containing "malicious code", when it only has two module scripts containing key-phrases to look for within experiences to flag as Malicious Scripts/Viruses. Roblox has denied our appeal 3 times.

For users still wishing to utilize the plugin it has been open-sourced on GitHub and can still be locally installed.
